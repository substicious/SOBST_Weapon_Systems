# SOBST Warfare Systems

Introducing the latest edition from the R&D team at SOBST Military Industries, SOBST Warfare Systems.

## Lore
```
Following the recent end of the war between Redwood Industries and The Green Drone Armada, SOBST 
Military Industries switched development from Military vessels to producing systems purposefully 
built for warfare. As SMI was not a weapon's manufacturer, the Research & Development team sent 
out scout ships to multiple systems in order to research any weapons found on crashed and derelict 
ships.

2 Years after SMI Command authorised the mission to scout for weapons, an R&D Scout Vessel, S3041, 
found an old, abandoned GDA research facility which was operating on backup power with it's main 
computer core intact. Due to its position close to a blackhole, attempts to communicate with 
command failed, so Captain S. Hood agreed to isolate the computer core and return to base for 
further investigation. What the team found took them all by surprise.
